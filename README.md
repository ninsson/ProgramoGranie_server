## Introduction

This project was developed as part of the **Human-Computer Interaction** course and involves modifying (gamifying) the official website of the Lodz University of Technology.

Our implementation idea — **ProgramoGranie** — focuses on modifying the Dante.pl platform.

## Project Concept

### Main Idea

#### Dante Games
The project introduces weekly events — **the Games**, where at a specific time a task prepared by the instructors becomes available, and students race to complete it as quickly as possible. The fastest students receive rewards in the form of **joker points**, which can be added to any course section, and **Dante coins**, which can be used to purchase cosmetic items.

#### Flappy Dante
To help students complete the task, they are allowed to play a mini-game — **Flappy Dante** — up to three times. Inspired by the classic Flappy Bird game, this allows students to earn a temporary currency — **flappy coins**. These coins can be used to, for example, buy a general hint for the task (prepared by the instructor) or gain access to a unit test (chosen by the student).

### Additional Features

Besides the main game, the project also includes a redesign of the Dante platform interface, including:

- a refreshed homepage with a dedicated Games panel
- an updated course statistics page
- a new user profile page featuring:
  - a panel for earned achievements
  - a panel for unlocked Flappy Dante skins
  - small additional features
